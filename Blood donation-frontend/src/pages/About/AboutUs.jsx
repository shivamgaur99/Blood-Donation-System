        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded with a commitment to saving lives, we started as a small group
          of volunteers passionate about making blood donations accessible to
          everyone in need. Today, weâ€™re a growing community of donors,
          supporters, and heroes united by a simple goal: to provide hope and
          save lives through the gift of blood.
